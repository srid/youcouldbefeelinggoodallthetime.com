      <div>You simply see how silly it is to waste this only moment of being alive by feeling bad (see below), and if that doesn't work do something to take your mind off the current issue.</div>
      <div class="footnote-quote">
        <p><strong>RESPONDENT No 23:</strong> <em>What about when I find out what happened to end feeling good and I see
            that it is silly to keep worrying about it yet that doesn’t stop the worrying and I am not back to feeling
            good?</em></p>
        <p><strong>RICHARD:</strong> Two things immediately leap to mind ... (1) you value feeling worry (a feeling of
          anxious concern) over feeling good (a general sense of well-being) ... and (2) you have not really seen it is
          silly to feel bad (a general sense of ill-being). What I would suggest, at this point, is to feel the silliness
          of feeling bad (in this case feeling anxiety) ... then the seeing (as in a realisation) might very well have the
          desired effect (as in an actualisation) of once more feeling good.</p>
        <p><strong>RESPONDENT:</strong> <em>a) I am not able to see the silliness of feeling bad ...</em></p>
        <p><strong>RICHARD:</strong> Do you comprehend that, although the past was actual when it was happening, it is
          not actual now and that, although the future will be actual when it does happen, it is not actual now ... that
          only this moment is actual?</p>
        <p>If so, do you further comprehend that anytime you felt good/will feel good does not mean a thing if you are
          not feeling good now ... that a remembered occasion/an anticipated occasion pales into insignificance if you are
          feeling bad now?</p>
        <p>Furthermore, do you understand that to be living this moment – the only moment you are ever alive – by
          feeling bad is to be frittering away a vital opportunity to be fully alive ... to totally enjoy and appreciate
          being what you indubitably are (a sensate creature) whilst you are here on this planet?</p>
        <p>If so, is it not silly to waste this only moment you are ever alive by feeling bad ... when you could be
          feeling good?</p>
